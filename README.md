# AnimalGuesser

Animal guesser is a mind reading game developed for IOS devices. I always thought the Akinator game was really cool and simple.
So I decided to make a subset of the game, that can determine what animal the user is thinking of.
Currently, the project only has 10 animals that are hard coded. However, it shouldn't take too long to make the program read from a csv file if I implement more animals
and possible questions in the future.
The algorithm selects questions so that regardless of the user's answer (yes or no), the program is able to eliminate half of the remaining animals.
